# Material Selector
This tool allows user to determine which material to use when designing a component of a mechanical system.<br /> 
By entering the normal stress, shear stress, volumn and allowed weight, the program produces a list of allowed material determinded by two different theories: maximum shear stress theory and von-mises theory.<br />
<br />You can have more reading on normal stress and shear stress here: https://matmatch.com/learn/property/basic-stress-analysis-calculations<br />
